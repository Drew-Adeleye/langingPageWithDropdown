I challenged my self to build this website, but the problem is I have no idea how to it,
or lets say i have no idea how to implement some of the features. like the hamburger menu
and the dropdown. but after consuming enough youtube tutorials. i was able to build this on
my own .....(show clip) cool right?
so let to work.

after a couple (show clip) of hours i got the nav bar to work, but the problem now was how 
to implement the mobile view of the navbar. now usually the way its works is to 
style the navbar differntly on mobile. but i think in this case the easiest way to
do it, would be to create a totally diferent navbar on mobile. alright that the plan lets go

and after some housrs (show clip) this what the mobile navbar is like, now that all is left to do is
to hook up some javascript to make the hamburger actully clickable. and add animations and 
all that cool stuff

so yeah after doing all the javascript (show clip) we have the navbar looking like this now, 
with the dropdown and everything. alright so desktop (show clip) and mobile (show clip)
and finally just to intimidate you a little bit with my code (show clip) this is 
my javascript.

alright so the i'm done with the hardest part. what is left for me is to build the rest of 
the page and optimse for mobile and im done with the project.
